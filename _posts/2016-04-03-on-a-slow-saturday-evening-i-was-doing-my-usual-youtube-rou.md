On a slow Saturday evening, I was doing my usual YouTube rounds when I stumbled upon the trailer for the new "Hitman" movie. For those unfamiliar, the Hitman franchise revolves around "Agent 47", an emotionless, fearless and highly intelligent assassin. Hollywood has a terrible record when it comes to movies based on video game franchises (Princes of Persia, previous Hitman iteration, Resident Evil, Max Payne etc) and it does in fact perform a fantastic hatchet job on the Hitman franchise as well. 

The story revolves around the origins of the "Agent" program,  we're told that the original program was De-funded. The founders and surviving agents scattered all over the world, until a member of "The Syndicate" stumbled upon a key piece of evidence in order to locate the original founder and bring him back to the fold. The idea is to blackmail him in order to resurrect the highly successful "Agent" program. Now, 47 knows the dangers of the program and is tasked to stop this from happening by doing what he does best.  

For the next hour, we see 47 go around the world, performing fantastic executions with some decent camerawork in hallways, stairways, embassies, gardens, crossroads and the headquarters of "The Syndicate". Well, if the writers had at least done their homework, they'd know that 47 is an assassin and not Stallone in denial. He's supposed to be quick and efficient, not a loud gun-toting cowboy. To be fair, at least the scenes weren't boring to watch despite the terrible plot, character development and pacing. 

I guess Hollywood can never take a video game franchise seriously. The movie has been out for a good while now and if you can manage to find it on a decent streaming service, I'll suggest giving it a go (PSA: grab a drink while watching this one).
